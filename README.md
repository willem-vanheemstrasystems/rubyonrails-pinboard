To install gems when the network blocks access to rubygems for direct insatllation through the Gemfile, alternatively you can download each required gem here

https://rubygems.org/gems

Save the downloaded gem file to a temporary directory, then from within this temporary directory run the following command

gem install --force --local *.gem

This will install the gems.

NOTE: some gems may be dependent on other gems (so you will need to download them as well)

Always run the following command after this

bundle install

This will register the gems in your application.

Then restart the Ruby server by typing

rails server
